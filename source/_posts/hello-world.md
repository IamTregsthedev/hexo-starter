title: Were Builing A Blog Engine for Rocket
---
# Welcome to PBJAM Jamstack Egine

 Jamstack is amazing, the speed, and the hosting, it's pretty good. With that though, <br> Jamstack is also hard to matain and get started on. For some lazy Developers, *cough* Like us, We wanted to build an easier Jamstack Blog engine powered by a existing simple to use platform. In the past few months, we've tried mutlipe hosts, such as <br> ghost, Wordpress, Nodehost, DigitalOcean, and Stackbit. None of them were that good, and got expesnive fast.
 
 <br>
 
 That's why we're building PBJAM by hexo, we want to create a custom build of a engine, We want to build The Rocket Project as an exprince, a Build you've never seen. I'm a solo founder, with a fair share of knowledge, and I'm putting every single hour i can into this project.
